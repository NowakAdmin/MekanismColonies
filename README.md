<h3>A package that have goal to be a nice Minecraft mods: <a href="https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism">Mekanism</a> & <a href="https://github.com/ldtteam/minecolonies">MineColonies</a> smooth, but challenging to play integration.</h3>

<p>This is early release, some blueprints are just basic with no blocks, some have them already. For now I want to test how things fit together, what is possible and what is not.
</p>
<h3>What to expect?</h3>
<ul>
<li>all Minecolonies blueprints will be 10x10x10 the goal is to make buildings intresting in look, but not many blocks needed couse there will be a requirement to use Mekanism machines in probably every single building, which will hard impact needs on Osmium etc.</li>
<li>mekanism:steel_casing everywhere (for now). </li>
<li>I'm not sure right now what other mods will be required now i test mekanismadditions blocks like plastic stairs probably starting from tier 3.</li>
<li>I think about making machines inside huts somehow usable by player.</li>
<li>Multiblocks builded by builder colonist (never forget layout!)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Some issues i see</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Problem with upgrading tiers of Fission reactor - probably becouse of (input/output) setup or just of block placement. Im investigating.</li>
  <li>Some Mekanism blocks cant be made by Minecolonies NPC like Fission Reactor Port.</li>
  <li>Will this be only a MineColonies Blueprints pack or a whole mod?</li>
  <li>..Mekanism is missing a wood stripper..</li>
</ul>
