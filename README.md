<h3>This is a package that have goal to be a nice integration of two Minecraft mods: <a href="https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism">Mekanism</a> & <a href="https://github.com/ldtteam/minecolonies">MineColonies</a>.</h3>

<p>This is early release, some blueprints are just basic with no blocks, some have them already. For now I want to test how things fit together, what is possible and what is not.
</p>
<h3>What to expect?</h3>
<ul>
<li>all Minecolonies blueprints will be 10x10x10 the goal is to make buildings intresting in look, but not many blocks needed couse there will be a requirement to use Mekanism machines in probably every single building, which will hard impact needs on Osmium etc.</li>
<li>mekanism:steel_casing everywhere (for now). </li>
<li>I'm not sure right now what other mods will be required now i test mekanismadditions blocks like plastic stairs probably starting from tier 3.</li>
<li>I think about making machines inside huts somehow usable by player.</li>
<li>Multiblocks builded by builder colonist (never forget layout!)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1. Download.ism blocks cant be made by Minecolonies NPC like Fission Reactor Port.</li>
